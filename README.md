# **RLViz**: an Interactive Tool for Visualizing Reinforcement Learning

Visualization Tool based on Gridworld. It supports Dynamic Programming algorithms (Value Iterarion and Policy Iteration), Temporal Difference algorithms (Q-Learning and SARSA), and customizable grid, agent and learning aspects.

This repository holds the source code of this project (made with Unity) and also my [final report](PGCIII_Relatorio_Final.pdf) (in portuguese).

You can also access the [web version](https://igornerest.github.io/rlviz-web/).
